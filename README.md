# MedaChain

This is a web application that uses the blockchain technology. Solidity, JavaScript, web3 and other technologies are used in this project.

It allows doctors, patients, and pharmaceutical companies to organise and verify medical records in a simple and efficient manner. There are numerous advantages to this method.

Some of the benefits of this system:-

1. Because Block-Chain Technology is used, each and every transaction conducted by people is always visible and unchangeable.
2. Because of this immutability, medical records for a person can never be falsified because they can be verified using transaction records or the verification site supplied.
3. This has the potential to reduce the number of fake physicians, as their diagnoses or reports can never be swapped with the real, have no existence on the block-chain, and can be easily recognised by verifying them on the verification portal.
4. We've only scratched the surface of the iceberg here. If certain procedures or standards are properly enforced across an area, it is possible that many malpractices that would have occurred in the absence of this system will be eliminated.
5. With this kind of growth potential, it also opens up a few new sectors, such as a single portal for all medical needs, such as hospital and doctor ratings, best hospital and doctor locations, and so on.

//How our prototype works

> It has a front-end made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
> We’ve created and deployed a smart contract made in solidity on test block-chain network.
> We’ve used web3js for connecting and communicating with the smart contract.
> We’ve used meta-mask for account idetification and transaction purpose.
> Ganache to create a local block-chain network for testing.
